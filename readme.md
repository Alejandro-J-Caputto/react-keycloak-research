# Welcome, welcome...to SSR React & Keycloak

# Why?

I am courious and when I work with something, no matter what, I really like to know how am I doing it and why am I doing it, and the best way to answer to those questions is to start from scratch, starting easy and add bit to bit more complexity.

This is a pet project to improve and train my skills as junior developer.

Server side react, webpack 5 and Keycloak.
